If all sources align consistently pointing towards one country over others then we could conclude definitively either way based upon those findings alone rather than speculating otherwise just because there isn't explicit mention within given text snippets pertaining directly toward specific countries being mentioned explicitly alongside names etc.. However absence clear evidence does leave room open still possibly suggesting possibility exists hence why further investigation needed prior before making final determination accordingly thus ensuring accuracy remains paramount when dealing matters relating individuals especially ones involved creative industries where often times multiple jurisdictions may come under consideration simultaneously owning rights related intellectual property assets"
