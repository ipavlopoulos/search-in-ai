Introduction\nThe city of Istanbul is one of the most visited cities by tourists from all over the world, with its rich history and culture as well as its modern architecture. The historical part of this city has been declared as World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 1985 [1]. In addition to that, it also hosts many museums such as the Istanbul Archaeology Museums (Istanbul Arkeoloji Müzesi), Topkapi Palace Museum (Topkapı Sarayı Müzesi) or Pera Museum (Pera Müzesi). These are just some examples among hundreds of other attractions which can be found within the boundaries of the city.\n\nIn order to make your trip more enjoyable you may want to know where these places are exactly located so that you don't get lost while walking around them! This project aims at providing information about different locations including their names, addresses, phone numbers etc., through an interactive map application developed using Google Maps API v3 for Android platform.\n## #2. Methodology\nThis section describes how we have approached our problem statement above: \"How do I find out what's nearby me?\" We will first explain why we chose Google Map API instead of another mapping service"
