The protagonist(s) would then embark on a journey to explore this new world, encountering various aliens, races, and cultures along the way. These encounters would be interspersed with flashbacks from their own lives, providing insight into their backstories and motivations for being lost on this strange new planet. As they delve deeper into these parallel universes, each story would culminate in a climactic battle between the protagonists and one or more powerful enemies. The companion books would serve as additional background material and character development for the main characters, while also exploring the larger themes and ideas of the overall series."
