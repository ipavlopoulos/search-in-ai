Yes, both Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood are American filmmakers. Based on the document, Ed Wood is confirmed to be an American filmmaker. Since the instruction does not provide any definitive information about Scott Derrickson'atively being an American or of any other nationality, we cannot conclusively answer the question with the given constraints. Instead, we could assume him to be American based on very common knowledge about the majority of notable filmmakers in Hollywood; however, this is not a fact strictly grounded in the given content. Given the inability to confirm Scott Derrickson's nationality from the provided document and considering that the majority of acclaimed American filmmakers are indeed from the United States, and no other information contradicts this assumption, we infer that Scott Derrickson is likely American as well. However, it should be noted that such an inference would not be strictly corroborated by the document details."
