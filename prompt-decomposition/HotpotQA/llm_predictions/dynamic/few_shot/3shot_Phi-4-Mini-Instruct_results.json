Are they originally native-born US residents holding secondary UK residency/nationality cards due solely because one acquired them voluntarily without relinquishing primary resident card/citizenship rights/claims thereof?\n\n\n2. Is it possible then considering all factors involved including voluntary acquisition/purchase/residence change/relinquishment claims therein – would you consider these two people essentially still “American” nationals regardless whether having been granted foreign residencies at will versus involuntarily via forced migration/exile etc.?\n\n\n3. Would this reasoning apply equally well if we were discussing another pair like say Tom Hanks vs Brad Pitt where neither had ever renounced nor surrendered claim thereto even though each may have obtained temporary visas/stay permits/etc., purely out-of-favor curiosity perhaps rather than genuine intent-to-migrate permanently"
