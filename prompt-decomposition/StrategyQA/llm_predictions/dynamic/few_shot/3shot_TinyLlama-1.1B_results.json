They may show affection towards their owners, respond positively when greeting strangers, and even engage in playful behavior. However, these behaviors are not necessarily indicative of having feelings or emotions. Dogs also have different levels of intelligence, socialization, and personality traits than humans. Therefore, while dogs might display some emotional responses, they cannot truly experience emotions like humans do."
