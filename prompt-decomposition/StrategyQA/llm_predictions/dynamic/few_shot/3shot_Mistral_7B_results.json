For instance, the \"Eagle Scout\" rank in Boy Scouts represents the highest achievement in scouting.\nBears, on the other hand, may signify power, resilience, and determination. Some youth groups use bear themes to emphasize these characteristics while fostering teamwork and camaraderie among members.\nTherefore, although neither eagles nor young bears are universally employed as exact synonyms for skills-training youth groups, they do carry significant meanings related to personal growth and character building."

        "3_shot_decomposition": "An Olympic athlete's fitness level varies depending on their sport and individual abilities. A mile run (1609 meters) may not tire out all Olympic athletes as it depends on their training regimen and conditioning. However, some endurance sports athletes like long-distance runners might find a mile run relatively easy due to their regular training. For other athletes whose events do not require extensive cardiovascular capacity, a mile run could present a challenge but would likely not leave them completely exhausted. It ultimately depends on each athlete's specific physical capabilities and preparation."
