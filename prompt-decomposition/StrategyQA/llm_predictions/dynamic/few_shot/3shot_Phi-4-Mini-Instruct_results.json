So ultimately depends heavily onto personal attributes/abilities alongwith specific circumstances prevailing then deciding outcome accordingly!\n\nConclusion drawn hereafter summarizing above discussed aspects involved within answering posed question accurately reflecting probable outcomes realistically possible scenarios occurring amidst given context(s).
