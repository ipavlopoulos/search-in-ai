If we consider only those teams who compete against other teams (as opposed to exhibition matches), then yes, everyone has to play.\n\nHowever, if we include exhibitions where some players may not even get into the game at all, then this requirement becomes less clear-cut; after all, what happens if two-thirds of your roster gets injured before they can take any ice time during regular season play? In such cases, perhaps only half of them will count towards wins anyway! But again - these things vary depending on league rules so I won't go further down that rabbit hole here because it's just too complicated.\n\n\n## What about professional sports leagues like MLB/NBA/MLS/etc.? Do they require participation from ALL players OR JUST SOME OF THEM TO COUNT TOWARDS WINNING THE CUP/CHEMISTRY CHALLENGE?\n\nIn most major pro sports leagues today including Major League Baseball (MLB) National Basketball Association(NBA),National Hockey"
