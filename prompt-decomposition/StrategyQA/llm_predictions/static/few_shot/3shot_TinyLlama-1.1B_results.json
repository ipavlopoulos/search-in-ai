The name \"Apollo 13\" was given to the spacecraft that launched astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise Jr., and Jack Swigert during NASA's Apollo 13 mission in 1970. It was later renamed USS ______ (APOLLO 13) due to its association with the Apollo program."

However, I don't consider myself an elite runner, so my energy requirements would likely be lower compared to professional athletes. \nI hope these clarifications help!
