        "3_shot_decomposition": "Sure. Here's the answer to your questions:\n\n**Mixed martial arts (MMA)** is not totally original from Roman Colosseum games. Both share some similarities, such as the use of violence and competition. However, there are also significant differences between the two forms of combat. For example, MMA is regulated by governing bodies and has a structured set of rules and regulations, while the Colosseum games were unregulated and often violent. Additionally, MMA is a modern form of combat that has evolved over many years, while the Colosseum games were a spectacle of ancient Rome.\n\n**The cuisine of Hawaii** is known for its fresh seafood and tropical fruits. While some traditional Hawaiian dishes do contain animal products, there is a growing trend towards plant-based options. Many restaurants now offer vegan and vegetarian options, including salads, soups, and curries.\n\n**Giant squid** can be captured in natural habitats, but it is a challenging and dangerous task. The squid are large and powerful, and they can escape if not handled properly. In addition, the capture of giant squid often involves using heavy nets or traps that can cause injury or death to the animals."
