Bachelor's programs require four years of study while associates' courses last two years.\n\nBachelor's programs provide more comprehensive training than those offered through associate degrees. They also allow students to specialize in certain areas such as pediatrics, gerontology, etc., whereas most associate-level classes focus solely upon general health care knowledge.\n\nAssociate level nurses typically work under supervision; however, some may choose to pursue further studies towards advanced practice licensure (APRN). This requires additional coursework beyond basic"

This was done so that spectators at the arena might see something more exciting than just watching men kill themselves over some trivial matter such as politics or religion; after all, what good is having money if you don't get any enjoyment out of life either way right now huh? So anyway...the point here is that while modern day mma may not look like much compared to its predecessors because we've got better technology nowadays which allows us to film everything going down inside those arenas back then - still though! It's pretty clear how closely related our current version actually IS TO THE OLDER FORMS OF FIGHTING SPORTS THAT WERE PRACTICED BY OUR ANCESTORS LONG AGO!"
