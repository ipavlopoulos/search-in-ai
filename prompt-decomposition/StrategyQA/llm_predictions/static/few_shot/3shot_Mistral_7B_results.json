Instead, it was named after the city of Houston, Texas, as part of a tradition where US Navy ships have been given names reflecting their homeports. There has been some confusion due to another US Navy vessel, the USS Samuel B. Roberts (DE-410), which was named after the Battle of Samar during World War II. But the USS Houston did not share this connection."

Their appearance and powers do not align with the symbolism represented in the flag."

        "3_shot_decomposition": "An Olympic athlete's fitness level varies depending on their specific sport and training regimen. A one-mile run would not necessarily tire out all Olympic athletes as some may train regularly at longer distances. However, it could represent a significant challenge for those who primarily compete in shorter events like sprinting or weightlifting. Additionally, factors such as current form, mental preparation, and environmental conditions can also impact performance during a mile run. Overall, while a mile run might not exhaust every Olympic athlete, it could certainly provide a challenging workout."
