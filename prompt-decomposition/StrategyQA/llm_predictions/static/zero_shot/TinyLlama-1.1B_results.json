Alternatively, they could paint the flag on a large canvas or wallpaper it onto a banner. Whatever design they choose, the Powepuff Girls' artistic flair would add a unique touch to the traditional symbol of Azerbaijan."

An Olympic athlete is trained for long distances and has been conditioned to run at high intensity levels over extended periods without fatigue. They may still feel some physical exhaustion from the intense training regimen, but it wouldn't necessarily lead them to say \"I am exhausted\" as you did in your question."
